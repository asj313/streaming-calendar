October 1, 1985. The chilling emptiness in Michele Avila's eyes. Her murder, a savage ballet of teenage fury, ripped through the town, festering wounds exposing the venomous underbelly of a seemingly innocent friendship. Jealousy, a serpent coiled in the heart of adolescence, struck with the force of a viper, revealing the terrifying depths of envy's reach. These weren't just girls; they were predators.  Women are born with many layers, a mix between good and evil. Ironically of all the positive tropes that can validate the existence of women, why is it that \"Born Sexy Yesterday\" is a trope that resonates with our male counterparts the most?",
