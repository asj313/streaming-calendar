      "synopsis": "The phrase \"Born Sexy Yesterday\" is derived from the 1950 film \"Born Yesterday.\" However beneath this superficial portrayal of some women lies a more complex understanding , revealing deeper narratives that resonate with many.  October 1, 1985. The chilling emptiness in Michele Avila's eyes. Her murder, a savage ballet of teenage fury, ripped through the town, festering wounds exposing the venomous underbelly of a seemingly innocent friendship. Jealousy, a serpent coiled in the heart of adolescence, struck with the force of a viper, revealing the terrifying depths of envy's reach. These weren't just girls; they were predators.  Women are born with many layers, a mix between good and evil. Ironically of all the positive tropes that can validate the existence of women, why is it that \"Born Sexy Yesterday\" is a trope that resonates with our male counterparts the most?",

He was a rebel who led the studio in suspensions for chronically refusing to direct the scripts handed to him by the brass, waiting instead for material that better suited his interests and thematic preoccupations. He was also one in a secretive fraternity of gay directors who had to conceal their identities and shield their private lives from potential public ruination. Daniel Kremer takes you through an unexamined and misunderstood life of a man of great artistic inclination who expressed his innermost yearnings covertly through his work in motion pictures.",

Many of the finest critics and film writers wrote of his style admiringly, even as studio contracts regularly saddled him with empty commercial vehicles. Quentin Tarantino even credited him as the director of the faux action saga The 14 Fists of McCluskey in his Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood.
